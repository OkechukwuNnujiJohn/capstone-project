6. As a user, I want the website to offer a bookmark or favorites feature, so that I can save my frequently used locations (e.g., home, work) for quick access and easier ride requests.
7. As a user, I want the website to support multiple languages, so that I can use it comfortably even if I'm not proficient in the local language.
8. As a user, I want the website to have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, with clear navigation and easy-to-understand instructions, so that I can use it without confusion or frustration.

10. As a user, I want the website to have a rating and review system for drivers, so that I can provide feedback and help maintain a reliable and safe transportation service.
